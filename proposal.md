Introduction:

What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful? (be brief here, you can expand more later!)
Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? (AKA Stakeholders)

Literature Review:

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Data and Methods:

Since we have data:
You will include a link to your data, along with summary information (e.g., how many columns, rows, and the types of features). Also include some discussion about the data's provenance - how do you know the data is reliable? Does it have meta data, and if not, what else do you know about it? If you anticipate needing more than one dataset, please indicate each dataset you anticipate needing and provide evidence that those datasets are available.

Methods
Describe your modeling approach. What sorts of transformations / preprocessing are going to be necessary? What sorts of modeling techniques will you apply? How are you going to evaluate your models (note that your evaluation should be consistent with stakeholder needs)?
